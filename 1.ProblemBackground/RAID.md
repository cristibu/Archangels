| - Medical data is being stored, which is of high value to hackers.<br/>- <br/> | - Security will be of even higher priority than normal, with extra authentication checks made around medical data actions. <br/>- A high security COTS product will be considered for giving 3rd parties access to shared medical data, to avoid reinventing the wheel and the possibility of making mistakes.<br /> |
| **Issues**                                                   | **Decisions**                                                |
| (list issues as they arise - none yet) <br/>- <br/>          | See [ADRs](../4.ADRs)                                        |
