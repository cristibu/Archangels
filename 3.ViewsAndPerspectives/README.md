# Views and Perspectives

When dealing with complex systems, it helps to view them in as many different views as possible to get a better understanding.

It is best to start with the Functional View. It's a single diagram that shows what's expected of the Farmacy Family system. Then look at the Event Storming diagrams to see the major Domain Events in the system. Then look at the C4 Models which show the software elements at context, container and component level. Finally, look at a few detailed scenarios.
