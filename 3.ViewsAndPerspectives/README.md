# Views and Perspectives

When dealing with complex systems, multiple views from different perspectives of the users and builders of the systems gives a better understanding.

The Functional View contains one diagram to show what's expected of the Farmacy Family system, the Event Storming diagrams have initial analysis done to discover Domain Events and the C4 Models depict a set of abstractions used to describe the static structure.
