# C4 Infrastructure Models

A C4 model is a common set of abstractions to create used to describe the static structure of a software system; these abstractions having four levels: **software system**, **containers**, **components** and **code**. **People** use the software system.

The following diagrams use the standard C4 notation.

## Context Diagram (Level 1 - top level)

A **System Context** diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.[^](#expl) 
This diagram shows how the main users of Farmacy Family interact with the system, and the other systems that Farmacy Family system interacts with.
