# Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-10-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

One of the biggest decisions to make is if and how we initially break the application into distinct building blocks.
There are many potential patterns such as building a monolithic application, creating a modular monolith or microservices, for example.

We should consider ease of development, and the architecture of the existing Farmacy Foods application.
